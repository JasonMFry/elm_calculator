** Caveats
This solution is in Elm instead of JavaScript. I have previously done this
challenge using JavaScript so I thought using Elm would be appropriate here. I
can produce my previous JavaScript solution if we want a good laugh :D

This passes all tests listed in the pdf but does not completely reproduce the
behavior of the iOS calculator. There are a few errors in the behavior, which I
have commented in the code.

The doMath function feels a bit sloppy but no better solution immediately came
to mind.

I would have liked to added tests but I'm unfamiliar with Elm's testing options
and opted not to spend time figuring it out.
